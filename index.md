<p>Hi there! I'm a PhD student in Biostatistics at the <a href="https://www.umass.edu/public-health-sciences/" target="_blank">UMass Amherst School of Public Health and Health Sciences</a>. I have deep interests in statistical and data science methods for large-scale biomedical data.</p>

<p>In my current engagement, I use these methods to understand complex health outcomes, particularly within the context of cardiovascular diseases and other chronic health outcomes. Beyond research, I'm also involved in mentorship programs focused on career and professional development involving diverse undergraduate and pre-college students (<a href="https://sites.google.com/view/ekoglobalfoundation/about/the-team?authuser=0" target="_blank">see my recent engagement here</a>).</p>

<p>Before joining UMass Amherst, I earned a Statistics BS from the <a href="https://www.knust.edu.gh/" target="_blank">Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology</a>, Ghana.</p>

<p>Fun fact: I once built a weekly cleaning schedule using R and emojis, just because I think even chores deserve a good data structure!</p>
