I got featured in a [UMass Amherst School of Public Health and Health Sciences](https://www.umass.edu/public-health-sciences/) promotional video for the Biostatistics Ph.D. program.

In this video, I briefly talk about my general experiences in the doctoral program in terms of coursework, research, and the various opportunities it offers me to collaborate with faculty and other researchers on varying projects. I also talk about the support that the department provides students, be it student advising, funding, among others.

Prospective students are encouraged to visit the [program's website][bio-epi] for more information.
